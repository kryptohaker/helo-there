# helo-there

An intentionally vulnerable SMTP-like client for teaching classic memory safety vulnerabilities.

## Security Warning

This program contains **deliberate security vulnerabilities** and should never be used in production environments or exposed to untrusted users. It is designed strictly for educational purposes.

## Purpose

This binary is designed to teach students about:
- Reverse engineering and binary analysis
- Memory safety vulnerabilities
- Binary exploitation techniques  
- Secure coding practices (by demonstrating what not to do)
- Vulnerability research and analysis

## Usage

Run the compiled binary and interact with it via standard input:

```bash
./helo-there
```

Type `HELP` to see available commands.

## Troubleshooting

### Missing 32-bit Libraries
If the program fails to run with errors like:

```
$ ./helo-there
bash: ./helo-there: cannot execute: required file not found
```

OR

```
bash: ./helo-there: No such file or directory
```

This indicates missing 32-bit compatibility libraries on your 64-bit system. To address this, the appropriate 32-bit glibc package needs to be installed.

```
sudo apt-get install libc6-i386
```

## Challenge

**Primary Objective:** Find as many distinct ways as possible to make the program report that you are authenticated.

**Rules:**
- No source code modification
- No binary patching  
- Pure black-box analysis from the provided binary

**Skills Required:**
- Static analysis and reverse engineering
- Dynamic analysis and debugging
- Understanding of assembly and binary formats
- Creative thinking about edge cases and unexpected inputs

## Educational Value

This program demonstrates several classes of vulnerabilities commonly found in C programs. Students should first reverse engineer the binary through static and dynamic analysis, then analyze the recovered/provided source code to identify potential security issues, and finally develop proof-of-concept exploits.

## Tools for Analysis

Recommended tools for students:
- **Static Analysis:**
  - **objdump** - Binary disassembly and analysis
  - **readelf** - ELF file format inspection
  - **strings** - Extract printable strings from binary
  - **hexdump/xxd** - Raw binary examination
  - **Ghidra/IDA** - Advanced disassemblers (optional)

- **Dynamic Analysis:**
  - **GDB** - Interactive debugging and runtime analysis
  - **ltrace** - Library function call tracing
  - **strace** - System call tracing
  - **Valgrind** - Memory error detection

## Academic Use

This binary is provided for educational purposes in academic settings. Instructors can use it as-is for reverse engineering challenges, or contact the author for source code access to create custom variations.
